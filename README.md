# simple-neural-net-model-editor
Inspired by this video of Brandon Rohrer: https://youtu.be/ILsA4nyG7I0  
my OOP project  
This is an extremely simple neural net application.
Sometimes the code gets really dirty, but I had finishing my OOP project in time, so I may have used bad programming practices, whatever :P
There is NO BACKPROPAGATION NO LEARNING NO NOTHING. yet.  
Have fun ^^
