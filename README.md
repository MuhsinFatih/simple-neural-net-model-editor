# simple-neural-net-model-editor
my OOP project
This is an extremely simple neural net application (by simple I mean noob level, which I am..)
Sometimes the code get really dirty, but I had finishing my OOP project in time in mind so brace for impact if you gaze on my code, it might hurt :P)
There is NO BACKPROPAGATION NO LEARNING NO NOTHING. yet.
So there you go, have fun ^^
